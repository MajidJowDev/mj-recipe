# in this case the english lang is demonstrated
# 1st if messages_en_GB or messages_en_US were available this prop files will be selected
# 2nd if the 1st priority were not available then the messages_en will be selected
# 3rd if none of the above were available the messages.properties will be selected
# if the language locale 'Accept-Language' were not available among the properties the app falls back to use the default messages.properties
